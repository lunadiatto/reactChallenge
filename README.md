# reactChallenge

This project simulates a calculator in React.

In the project directory, you can run `npm start`, that runs the app in the development mode.  
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

When the app is rendered, you will see a button ADD ROW to add a row to the calculator. When clicked, it renders a row with:

- a select for the math operator (+ or -)
- an input where you can write a number
- a button DELETE to delete the row
- a button DISABLE to momentarily disable the row, you can then click it again to enable the row

Under that you can see the result of the operation, updated every time the operators or the numbers change.
